## How to Read a Paper? :page_with_curl:
Reading a paper is not the same as reading a blogpost or a novel. Here are a few handy resources to help you get started.

* [How to read an academic article](https://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/08/31/how-to-read-an-academic-article/)<br>
* [Advice on reading academic papers](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~akmassey/posts/2012-02-15-advice-on-reading-academic-papers.html)<br>
* [How to read and understand a scientific paper](https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/08/25/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper-2/)<br>
* [Should I Read Papers?](http://michaelrbernste.in/2014/10/21/should-i-read-papers.html)<br>
* [The Refreshingly Rewarding Realm of Research Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eRx5Wo3xYA)<br>
